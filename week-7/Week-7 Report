This week was developing the website using HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript.

Code:
Code is available in Docket/week-7/index.html

Problems encountered:
As the code is getting increased, it is getting complex to add new code between the existing code between CSS, HTML and JavaScript

How I solved it:
As I keep coding, i'm learning through it and i'm able to solve by trying and changing the code using logic.
