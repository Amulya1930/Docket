This week was developing the website using HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript.

Code:
Code is available in Docket/week-8/index.html
Code is available in Docket/week-8/index.js
Code is available in Docket/week-8/styles.css
Code is available in Docket/week-8/sign-up.html

Problems encountered:
I have encountered problem with the GitHub, where I was getting an error message saying my origin/master and the master branch are diverged. I din't understand what it meant. I was also getting a status message regarding the .DS file of the week-8. 

How I solved it:
I then opened the terminal to see the Git Status using commands. After a lot of effort, I tried pausing my .DS file and merging the rest of the files of the week-8. The issue has then been resolved.
