What I developed:
This week was developing the website using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Also, I have created the local host server using MySQL and PHP.

Code:
Code is available in Docket/week-10

Problems encountered:
I have encountered problem when setting the database. MySQL has given a lot of problem to run on my Mac Book.   Along with this creating a local host also was not easy. 

How I solved it:
I had to uninstall and install many times for that to run. I also tried to run it using the command window. After a lot of attempt, running SQL was successful. 
I had to do a lot of research to create a local host on Mac. After a lot of browsing and reading, I got to know MAMP software would help me build a local host from the Apple Mac OS using MySQL and PHP.
