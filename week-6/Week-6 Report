This week I started developing the website using Javascript along with HTML 5 and CSS.

Code:
Code is available in Docket/week-6/index.js

Problems encountered:
This was the first time I implemented JS with no experience. It took some time for me to figure out and code based on idea of my project.

How I solved it:
I have gone through some websites and watched couple of JavaScript tutorials and learnt.
