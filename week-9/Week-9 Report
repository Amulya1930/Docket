This week was developing the website using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I have developed HTML and CSS webpages for List of Dockets, Popular Dockets and Your Checklists.

Code:
Code is available in Docket/week-9
Code can also viewed in backtoschoolshoppingchecklist.html , coordinationchecklists.html	, disciplinechecklists.html, kitchencleaningchecklist.html, taskchecklists.html, travelchecklist.html, trekkingchecklist.html, weddingchecklist.html and troubleshootchecklists.html

Problems encountered:
I have encountered problem when building the CSS pages for all of the different checklists. I found it complex buidling all of them in the sane styles.css file. 

How I solved it:
So I tried to create different HTML and CSS files to make it look and understand clear.
